# Overview

As a software engineer looking to expand my programming language knowledge, I created this Kotlin Hello World application to familiarize myself with Kotlin's syntax and development environment. This simple console application demonstrates the basic structure of a Kotlin program and serves as my first step into the Kotlin ecosystem.

The software is a fundamental "Hello, World!" program that outputs a greeting message to the console. While simple in nature, it establishes the foundation for understanding Kotlin's function declarations, entry points, and standard output operations.

My purpose for creating this software is to begin my journey with Kotlin programming language, understanding its syntax differences from other languages I know, and setting up a proper development workflow that I can build upon for more complex Kotlin applications in the future.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my primary development environment with Kotlin language support extensions. The development setup included the Kotlin compiler (kotlinc) for compiling and running the application from the command line.

The programming language used is Kotlin, which is a modern, statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java and is officially supported by Google for Android development.
